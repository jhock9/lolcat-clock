# Lolcat Clock

Lolcat Clock is a web application that displays an interactive clock.

## Project Description

The Lolcat Clock project is based on the popular LOLcat memes. The objective of this project is to use vanilla JavaScript and DOM manipulation to create a clock that features:

- The current time.
- Images that change depending on the time of day, with corresponding greetings (i.e., "Good Afternoon" in the afternoon).
- Three different timers for wake-up time, lunch time, and nap time.
- Images that change when each of the timers go off.
- A "Party Time" button that changes color when clicked, and also changes the image.

This project is built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
